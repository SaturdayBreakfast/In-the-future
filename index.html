    <h1>In the future......</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        How many years in the future do you want to look?
        <br>
    
        <input class="years">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Name a place- It doesn't have to exist yet- you have years!
        <br>
        <input class="place">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Add a verb- something you'd be doing at this place
        <br>
        <input class="verb">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Something you'd shout, at a moment of inspiration or realization
        <br>
        <input class="shout">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Someone you know, or think you will know in the future
        <br>
        <input class="person">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <button>I see it...</button>
        
        <p>So, I predict, in about <span class="yearspan">(year)</span> years, you'll be at <span class="location">(place)</span>, <span class="move">(verb)</span>, Trying to remember something important. Then, an idea hits you. <span class="callout">(shout)</span>, you shout, running down the street like you're in a marathon. You were supposed to meet with <span class="friend">(person)</span>! </p>
